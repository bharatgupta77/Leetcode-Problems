## 📝 Problem Description

Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

 

Example 1:

Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The above elevation map (black section) is represented by array [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]. In this case, 6 units of rain water (blue section) are being trapped.

Example 2:

Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9

 

Constraints:

	n == height.length

	1 <= n <= 2 * 104

	0 <= height[i] <= 105

## ✅ My Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:

        left = 0 
        right = len(height) - 1
        left_max = 0 
        right_max = 0
        water = 0

        while left < right:
            if height[left] < height[right]:
                left_max = max(left_max, height[left])
                water += left_max - height[left]
                left += 1
            else:
                right_max = max(right_max, height[right])
                water += right_max - height[right]
                right -= 1
    
        return water
                    


        
```
